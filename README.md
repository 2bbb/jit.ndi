Extensions for sending/receiving video and audio using the [NDI®](https://ndi.video/) protocol in [Cycling 74's Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/)

## Overview

The [NDI®](https://ndi.video/) protocol allows high-quality, high-performance, low-latency streaming of video and audio over a local network. jit.ndi provides a pair of objects to interface this protocol with the Max/Jitter environment, allowing sending/receiving of jitter matrices and MSP signals to/from any other device supporting NDI.

## Features
- NDI 6.0 compatible (runtime is dynamically loaded so will work with any installed compatible NDI version)
- Send/receive 2D jitter matrices of any size. 3-plane RGB and 4-plane RGBA both supported.
- YUV mode for high-performance usage.
- Send/receive unlimited number of audio channels.
- Objects can set/report preview/program tally status on a video source.

## Requirements
- Max 8 (64-bit) - Windows or Mac (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- NDI® Runtime - [Windows](http://ndi.link/NDIRedistV6) or [Mac](http://ndi.link/NDIRedistV6Apple)
